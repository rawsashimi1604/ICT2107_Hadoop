                "Pros": "1. People are generally nice, minimal/no office politics 2. Everyone is willing to share and offer help when necessary",
                "Cons": "1. Brief hierarchy of the company: Team Assistant (TA); Associate; Senior Associate; So on and so forth. If you just graduate from NUS/NTU/SMU, the entry level position offered to you will be Associate. If you're from any other local/private unis in SG, the entry level position the company deem suited for you is TA. So you may graduate the same year as your friend but they may be your superior because of your school:) These are applicable for fresh grads and majority of the teams only. TLDR, as a TA, you're basically everybody's assistant. You take instructions from anyone above your \"rank\" 2. Your day end at 7PM, so naturally you will miss your usual dinner time with your family and friends taking into consideration the travel time. (Timing can never match with your friends unless they starve and wait for you) 3. OT is norm and not paid (you feel elated when you're able to get out of office on time and still see bright sky lol. dont try to plan anything outside of work cause tasks are unpredictable and you may be given a task at 630PM and they expect you to complete asap) 4. Managers check in with you time to time and after sharing your concerns, work are still given to you (mgrs check for the sake of checking, they also need to report mah) 5. People are still working on leave/after office hours. Receiving messages and emails at 12AM? norm 6. If you speak chinese a) awesome cause you can 'blend\" in easier and mgrs are generally glad to hear that you speak their mother tongue language b)boo cause you need to help your non-chinese speaking teammates (not their fault btw) with their work AKA translation. ppl from other teams will prefer to seek help from you than your teammate since they can communicate better with you in their language 7. No clear career progression, job scope not defined (always doing work with no background given) 8. Turnover rate high. around half of my teammates has left after staying for less than 6 months or before their 3 months probation. The burnout is real:) 9. Work is extremely manual. Time spent on Crtl C + Crtl V takes up your whole day, thats why the company needs TA 10. The only time you get to interact with your teammates is lunch time/ team bonding session (usually held after work but will still attend cause FOMO)"

                "Cons": "1) Lack of inspiring leadership from middle to senior management. - Management are usually parachuted from other departments without relevant experience (except working for the company). -Authoritarian leadership that does not allow room for differing opinions. Many managers have no choice but to execute decisions of senior management. - Decisions are often made in a knee-jerk manner, makes you wonder if the Management has any long term vision. E.g. Birthday leave was retracted less than 1 year after roll out; the direction for employees to book a seat via internal app was reversed less than 1 month after roll out. - Lack of trust for employees. It wasn't enough to enforce 5 days work from office, this was followed with an attendance tracking system to monitor time in office. 2) Elitism. Significantly different pay for the same role, depending on whether you are from local or private uni, or the honours class you graduated with. Recruiters ask for education transcripts from 'O' levels to university to benchmark you. 3) Slave driving culture. You don't get rewarded for volunteering to take on additional scopes but get a below-average performance grade instead. 4) Cost cutting is now the ultimate priority and done at all expense, including that of the welfare of employees. Welfare and benefits have been severely cut."

Official stance is attendance won't affect performance and is just to provide managers with \"visibility\" on employees working arrangement. But many can see the BS behind this. Shopee used to have attendance tracking in 2018 and has now reverted to this primitive method. What are we? Blue-collared workers stamping a time sheet? -Upper management changing workplace arrangements on a whim. Hot desk system was implemented and significant resources were poured into developing an app for booking tables. Then suddenly came the announcement to go back to 5 day full WFO. Everyone was working fine and delivering their deliverables, why make this useless change? - Birthday leave abruptly removed in first half of 2022. - many small things will be routed to senior management for approval. I'm pretty sure precious dollars are wasted if directors and whatnot have to manually screen through every application."

                "Cons": "Too political. The department of Customer Success is managed by a senior leadership whom prefers to promote people based on their tenure rather than the expertise they have built over time throughout their different experiences externally. There are also persistent tensions and rumours that are taken into account by management when they have to do performance reviews, and cold hard facts such as performance based on numbers is massively overlooked. People are afraid of speaking up and when they do with proofs of what they say, they don\u2019t get help or actions taken. Worst professional experience so far."

                "Pros": "- Truly care for the employee. Put in lots of effort for employee - End of year closure - Given RSU & budget for WFH setup during covid period - have ERGs, and mentorship groups - got to enjoy various exciting belonging group and activities: pool games, maker club, etc. before Covid - Vibrant office & ergonomic 'auto-desk' - Lots of horizontal jobs around",
                "Cons": "- Middle manager have too much control over individual promotion, growth, exposure,etc. If you get a good manager it is heaven, but once you got the bad one, it is absolute hell. And mind you there are some bad apples around. - System is old, outdated, lots of data integrity issue and all in silos. The company will need lots lots of effort & time to revamp all of this. - Low salary and very difficult to get increment. Small % increment even if there is any. - HR is useless. There was an ex colleague who had sexual misconduct issue, HR cant do anything and asked her to still talk to the perpetrator, so she needs to quit. - No psychological safety. Even GLINTS employee survey is just a way to bully the individual - Getting a promotion / job progression is very difficult and some even get same or lower pay. Summary: if you feel you manager is great, join this company and ask for higher pay. If you sense the manager is bad, run away."

Poor planning, there is no ramping up for new hire. There is no plan ahead for resources, where people just left and lost all the knowledge. New hire will have hard time to trace the history and pick up. Module is under one people responsible which is very dangerous. If that module owner happens to resign, the knowledge just gone.

Salary is way lower than average in the industry. HR has gone down in terms of their arrogant behaviour and treats interviewees in a more humane manner now. This could be because of the dramatic ongoing attrition. Female employees in the company are far less compared to males. There is some level of gender bias, and discrimination, especially seen among long served employees. HR offer far low salary to female employees than the male with the same skillset and experience. So, bias is top-down and starts with HR itself."

Asks us to talk to her directly if has any complains, but we end up get scolding instead. No one want to talk to her anymore. No understanding, no empathy.

Please do not give invalid reasons to fire people; this is outrageous. - There need to be transparent conversations between leaders and employees. The management should be more upfront with all the employees about company performance. - Leaders only focus on gaining credits. Despite verbally stressing their concerns for all employees' professional development, the leaders did nothing. For example, there is no monthly and quarterly performance review from the direct reporting managers. - The job scope is manageable: Many experienced HR professionals have been hired to perform simple job scopes, which junior employees can accomplish."

                "Cons": "Where do i begin? My list goes on... 1. Horrible talent management, they copy western companies' OKR and 360 degree performance review system, but TikTok leaders manipulated it in a way that you have to please your leader huge in order to get a good bonus as your 360 rating determines how much your bonus will be. That of course leads to a very top-down Chinese imperial management style. 2. Salary. HRBP and the team leads will try to negotiate so hard with you on your salary by leveraging the name TikTok which many believes it's the next Meta, but let's be honest, how far can TikTok go if they have a top-down management culture and bring in talents who later realise they're all underpaid? 3. Team leaders. Many of them are young and incompetent, they're in the lead position either because they know how to please the management or they are the loyalist, therefore, the more experienced talents will suffer big from inexperienced leads and unprofessionalism, they will feel very little chance to exceed unless they become a loyalist too. The team leaders' goals are very much for 360 performance review NOT because they want to bring impact, build a strong team nor nice culture. 4. Benefit. Many thinks employee benefit is good here, well, it maybe the case when the company was small and new here, it has been reducing employee benefits since ever, starts from hard salary negotiation by count in every cent of your flexible benefit and 3 months bonus you may or may not get (depends on how much your leader wants to give you), cheap lunch and snacks that are in trend to become worse due to cut in operation expenditure. 5. Corrupted leaders. Sexual harassment and hostile working environment are quite common, as mentioned, the result of a leader-pleased culture. 6. Resignation. This is a funny one. Let's say if your notice period is one month from 1 Nov to 30 Nov, then you agreed with HRBP to have your last day on 15 Nov, but you do not get paid for 1 Nov to 15 Nov in the end, because you need to pay back to TikTok for the shortened notice period from 16 Nov to 30 Nov! This is the most ridiculous policy i have ever experienced in my life... 7. Future outlook of social media platforms. In overall, weak moat for social media platforms like TikTok, look what happened at Meta and Twitter... TikTok has been expanding in oversea without a concrete plan since 2019, they do not even have headcount projection for each year, which means they could over hire without control. TikTok as the very few APPs that generates revenue, in current economic downturn, ad revenue will shrink, and when a Chinese company cuts its headcount, it can be brutal without anything like Meta gives employees 16 weeks salary, refer to what happened in tech sector in China. 8. My final advise, choose western companies over Chinese companies, for your own value system and mental health. TikTok may try to build its branding, but not if they understand the value of human dignity and respect."

Impact and Scope - The roles are brought and wide allowing for a lot of great projects to work on and stretch yourself. You can build amazing profile and achievements. 4. Daily food allowance and a lot of SWAG 5. Projects - a lot of problems to solve which will build your skills and experience. 6. Super fun and awesome user product. 7. 100% WFH and flexibility, until recently. 8. Speed - great start up speed that is maintained. You will learn to get things done and work fast. 9. High performance environment. 10. Incredible collaborative tools and cloud solutions making collaboration amazing and easy. You can work from any device with easy.",
                "Cons": "1. Low Compensation: - TikTok pays WAY less than FAANG closer to Tier 3 companies. - No COL adjustment and only top performing staff get annual increments, based on \u201cperceived performance\u201d. - Only ex-FAANG employees are paid well and have RSUs. The rest are underpaid. 2. Poor Benefits and Insurance - the benefits are below standard and the insurance is bad for a supposedly leading tech company. 3. Poor Management and Leadership: - Many of the senior management are ex-FAANG ICs who are given huge portfolio in TikTok. - In APAC, senior leaders can be incredibly rude. 4. Heavy Perf Review Cycles: - Heavy perf cycles every 6 months with low pay adjustments, if any. - There is no clear guidance on what is high performance. 5. Secretive and Non Transparent: - Nothing is shared with employees and most FTEs are treated like contractors with even basic business data kept private or not allowed to be seen. - No pay bands are shared or explained. - Leaders do not answer questions in town-halls. - The employee survey results are kept secret and not shared even with mid-management. 6. Lack of Investment in the Employees: - The company has no Talent and Development team - Poor training team - No education reimbursements. - No rotation programs are available, either. - No mentorship programs. - No communities 7. WLB - It varies between teams, however overall it is intense. - Often you have to do 2 jobs at the same time with the low pay (see #1). - Your calendar blocks and time is often not respected. 8. Disorganised: - Very disorganised with re-orgs creating teams with no clear roles. - Frequent changes of direction, leaders and strategy. - Many overlapping teams and roles. - Mostly 2 months planning and very frequent changes. 9. No Care for Mental Health - no insurance coverage or care of your mental health and how you feel. Management only cares about revenue. 10. High Attrition and Decline in Talent - Attrition is high with average tenure around 1.5 yrs with some leaving in 2-4 months time. - The company has started to hire mediocre people, at best, or open positions internally only, since they\u2019re can\u2019t afford external candidates in this market."

Some don\u2019t care about your wellness (text you at night, keep getting you to do work for him/her to claim credits for, without knowing what you are doing day in day out, pretend to hear your feedback but don\u2019t really make changes).

This happened to me despite me telling IBM my current pay and expected new salary right from the start. This is ridiculous and I totally did not expect such bad experience from a global company like IBM."

I am sure we will be leading the technology of the world, transforming our future generations. If we see the 100+ years of IBM\u2019s journey, the company has sustained many market disruptions, reinvented itself many times and stood solid throughout.

The recruiter went on to tell me to wait even further for \"their business people to discuss further\" and they never did reply me to confirm anything. IBM recruiter then ignore my call and email to follow up on my case. This was very disappointing and frustrating.

This is because this company seems to prefer hiring low wage workers as much as possible. The pattern for juniors and foreigners is to work about 1-2 years and switch to other company. See the cons for long-term career consideration in this company. - Diversity exists, but seems in a bad way (see cons). - There is annual company stock discount for all full-times. - There is online learning coverage for Udemy and Coursera.",
                "Cons": "- Salary is below the market average, yet job roles can be demanding. - Diversity, mostly are Indonesian, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, is likely due to the above point. It is rare to see at least 3rd generation Singaporean in this company's IT and engineering division. If there are any Singaporeans, they are foreigners who had converted to Singaporean. - Promotion is based on both seniority and pleasing the management / French people rather than merits / skills. The effect is brilliant people leave after about 2-3 years of working and those in technical and management roles are filled with the average or bad ones. - Turnover rate is high and this company even gives 2000 SGD for a successful candidate hiring recommendation, close to what this company gives for a successful patent (1000-1500 EUR). - There are several high-ego managers and toxic colleagues. Sabotage and backstabbing do exist and you will be hardly be able to protect yourself when dealing with these toxic people. See the above 2 points on why this is happening. - Most French colleagues I have worked with are cunning, self-entitled, and arrogant towards Asian. It is hard to identify this since they always appear as very friendly. - Politics are strong in higher managements, especially if it is related to French people. - Not many brilliant people to work with and the experts' expertise are questionable. This is a cybersecurity company focused on applied cryptography and yet, most people inside do not have strong cryptography knowledge. - Health insurance coverages are average."

The other dept too are dominated by Indian. It is very normal to see a reporting structure of up to two or three level of indian mgm before reaching the french mgm. It is very safe for indians as they tend to work behind the door, indian style of management. You will fit very well if you are indian.",

As the culture is heavily leaning towards Indian culture, it easy to face racism, or simply lack of trust among the indian and non-Indian. Not surprising. Important roles or task usually heavily filtered despite how good you are. They tend to hire their own ppl for important task. Non indian will be filtered for low priority tasks. The rest of the non-Indian roles are more more to fill up the quota. But, indian are almost 90% , strange. Does they ever follow the quota? As you 3ill be working with mostly indian hired contract staff, the staff holds onto information due to insecurity. Be prepare that you will be celebrating Indian festive more than any of the national celebration."

When this is highlighted to management, they deny this is true. Yet when they hire new staff, they earn more than current staff. It just feels like a KYC factory here. No one cares how u feel or how u are coping. Just do files until u drop dead from exhaustion. Senior management has no KYC experience so they have absolutely no idea on what\u2019s happening on the ground Need to work in office during pandemic even though the job is 95% individual based and requires very little interaction with other colleagues. Now with pandemic over, everyone is 100% working in office. And nobody bothers to ask us if we are ok with coming back to office. We are just told to do so. Turnover rate here very high. People leave after 6 months or less. On the other end, those who can\u2019t find opportunities elsewhere are stuck here for years"

Mgt wld rather hire new employees than work at retaining seniors resulting in astronomical turnover rates. Within 1 year, most of the seniors have left once they had a job offer and mgt's solution is to mass hire fresh grads who dont know what they are getting themselves into. Training for fresh grads are inefficient and slow resulting in a buildup of backlog files and further exacerbating the vicious cycle. It also does not help that mgt decided to change the system of managing files, resulting in a buildup of backlog since last year when previous workload management was a lot smoother."

You'll be targeted by management and your performance appraisal will suffer. - In the data centre, many perks given by Meta are not applicable to you if you are not a manager. Management said you are not to \"take advantage of the company \" so don't assume the perks such as Global travel days, or even claims of mileage for work purpose to be allowed. They will be rejected by your line manager. - Overall culture is non-supportive and toxic with no flexibility. Expected to work in site office 5 days a week. - Data centre hired people who aren't very competent or capable. It's really puzzling , guess the loop interview is not working. - No career progress, almost impossible to get promoted. - Meta prides itself as a company that supports diversity but the Data centre is a strong supporter of CECA. - Avoid at all costs unless you are a yes man."

Being part of a team catering to internal customers, I have been interacting with not just product teams in Singapore but also from other locations such as Melbourne and Copenhagen. I loved this global exposure and also understood that in general the culture across the organization is empathetic, supportive and encouraging. I love the product that we are building, but the management is not very supportive or encouraging. At multiple occasions, I got the feeling that my concerns are falling on deaf ears, the management is not bold to take a stand, and most concerning, some managers are bringing in a blame culture (which I felt is just against the overall Zendesk culture). Probably, that's the reason, lot of folks from my existing team either moved out or moved to other teams.",

There are many opportunities and it is relatively open to exploring my interests even if they fall outside of my specific role. For example, I am passionate about learning foreign languages and as a company that has clientele around the globe, there are many conversations in non-English languages. I've been successful at getting myself into many of those conversations even though I was not directly hired for it. Zendesk also has an inclusive and welcoming environment. I have worked at the office in Madison and in Singapore and both have felt this way. The company organizes many events and is inclusive of all employees to participate. There is also an awesome feeling of empowerment both on the job and in the larger community. CSR is an important part of our job and even though I don't participate as much as others, it feels great to see our CEO so active. Lastly, it is open in terms of rank and file employees approaching management or senior management to express concerns or to socialize.",
                "Cons": "As a new company, many policies and procedures are not clearly defined, frequently change, or are simply not good. I think that as it is raplidly growing there is also constant change, which can be good for the opportunity it provides, but also bad as the structure can often be insufficient. There is also a lot of change as Zendesk continues transitioning away from start-up mentality (1600+ employees) to more corporate: more bureaucracy, more inflexible policies, more segmentation and siloing of responsibilities. Though these can be good things in ways, they can also be very negative for one seeking the openness and flexibility of startup."

They prefer to rely on offshore people and just focus on project management The management likes long term planning e.g. five year plans... There's no incentive to develop personally unless told in top-down manner by management It looks like consultants are oversold to clients, so they expect professionals, not juniors. My client that was using company services was so angry because of what they got, they were hostile to consultants and eventually stopped cooperation. Such approach is not uncommon, clients can be obnoxious towards consultants and the management even can't do much because at the end of the day, clients gives money... The fact that no one in the local management is in their 50's, is very worrisome. It means that the company couldn't develop strong enough business, so that more mature people would join them. I felt bad when was talking with some of the people from management, because of their immaturity"

There was a lot of effort done behind the scene for new joiners to have an amazing learning experience on TW ways of working. Personally it was a good refresher on Agile practices. Thanks to the whole team, each and every one brought their past experience and learnings to the table and we all worked together for a common goal with excellent team dynamics. Both trainers hosted all the sessions very well and guided each and everyone of us. Initial few days before onboarding project was also engaging time with lot of things to go through. All the activities were well planned and were very smooth. It didn\u2019t feel like one is starting fresh in a new organisation.",

I had the opportunity to attend a conference in Berlin using the budget. - The People (HR) team is awesome, and they focus on ensuring every TWer is looked after and provided the necessary support. - For most of the projects, as technical consultants we are given the opportunity to shape the product and decide the infrastructure - Probably the first technical team I have worked as a developer where the gender diversity ration is exactly 1:1.",

This is a good place to learn these skills. 2. There are many project sharing sessions, books clubs event etc. 3. No jerks policy - Many TW-ers you will meet are very friendly and jerks usually do not last long in TW. The management takes care of employees even during Covid-19 by sending snacks and hand-written cards.",
                "Cons": "1. Echoing what the previous reviews mentioned, there are limited trainings available in TW SEA. To add more details, most of the trainings in SEA are tapping onto programmes conducted by other TW offices or conducted by consultants who happen to be free. In SEA, there are also only 2-3 training licenses (e.g. PluralSight) being shared and rotated among hundreds of consultants and you can only keep one license for 3 months which is hardly enough. The personal training budget is also insufficient. 2. There are usually gaps between what was promised pre-hire and after hire. Have spoken to many new folks who are interested and expecting to do frontend or analytics from their interviews conversations but were all staffed to be full stack engineers. This might be because interviews, staffing and actual projects are handled by different people who are not aligned. 3. Attrition is high. Experienced consultants usually leave after a year or two, usually for higher compensation or job scopes better aligned with their own career interests. At the same time, there are many fresh graduates being hired. While I agree we can train fresh grads to be good developers, it will take time. We need to retain more experienced and talented individuals in TW first. This trend of TW SEA becoming bottom-heavy in terms of experience is getting worrisome for slips in capabilities and quality."

Junior devs are very much encouraged to be active in technical discussions and get to work closely with clients - You have the freedom and space of what you want to focus on and you'll be supported by your team/company. For example, you can focus more on being Infrastructure Engineer after a period of time focusing on App Development. - Really appreciate the feedback culture in the company - Most teams will practice regular feedback so you'll know where you stand and keep improving. - Some ThoughtWorkers are thought leaders in the industry too, it is very normal to see colleagues speaking at conferences, writing books, etc - Personally find it very inspiring. - The company is also huge and serious in making social impact in the world. There is a dedicated coordinator for all the social initiatives driven by the company, making it easier for employees to be engaged in social initiatives sustainably.",

Felt quite lost when I joined the company at first. And teams are generally working in silos in each client project, so if you're new and has no projects yet, it can be tough to get to know other employees. - Salary-wise is not the highest in the industry.

I have been working with them for quite a long time now and I can say both lack design skills and the leader mindset.  All they can do is just one thing... \"TALK\". Both can't deliver. I doubt if they have ever done any end to end design delivery.  Both head of design behave like mothers \"do this, do that\". They don't want to give autonomy to the team and want to control everything. Yup almost everything. e.g if both are busy the team gets messages like we can't make it today, let's cancel today's meet. We'll put something new\" which never happens. Every team conversation is just about two buzz words, 'Value' and 'Impact' but the team always wonders what exactly does that mean? I bet just like the team they also don't know what both words are and they just use them to show off. It's quite common in the office to use buzz words. Both ladies have two faces. One for TW & SG leadership team and this face is very shiny, everything is going excellent, we are leaders and design is adding tremendous value, another one is with a team which is very dark and scary. There is literally zero team communication which happens because nobody has any interest. Why because both leaders fail to create that environment for the team which TW MD's and HR failed to see and understand.Team feels both are incapable and lousy design leaders. It's just no one wants to talk about this because all they care about is just doing the job and getting a salary. Everyone in the design team is on the verge of leaving TW because of these two. Maybe that's the reason people have started moving out of TW. There are other tons of points but i know nothing will happen because TW MD's will just talk to these two and both are smart enough to cover and brainwash MD's. It's just hopeless. They have decided to hire Sr and Lead designers instead of promoting internally. Why? Because both leaders fail to connect designers/team or mentor designers so that they can grow.  All both care about is their 'own' growth and faking around. Question is who will save TW SG Design team?"

(aka no \"jerks\" policy) - Work in a team with knowledgable and inspiring technical people, which you can learn new things from - Project teams always carefully crafted to have a higher percentage of seniors and mid level developers as compared to juniors (aka your project will probably go smoothly and no death march) - Deployment of software is always through the automated Continuous Integration/ Deployment pipeline (aka no fear to release new version software, and no staying back late after working hours to fix deployment issue) - Get to be assigned to different projects, which means you get experience in many different languages and technologies to beef up your resume - This is a consulting job, so we have the chance to improve your tech communication skills, as you get to interact with clients (not a job where you just code), which will definitely be valuable in your future career. - There are often office events, and get togethers where we can interact with other teams, (aka: no silos) - Generous salary, and other benefits where the company foots your mobile and internet bill",

This act of pairing with others expedites your learning.",
                "Cons": "- Work life balance: In most of the cases, ThoughtWorks takes up very critical and rescue based projects. Because of the nature of the projects, you need to be expert in a technology to solve the issues that occur during the development. And at the same time, it is very difficult, especially in these modern days, to learn many tools and technologies out there in the market. This creates lots of pressure on the developers and makes you to work harder and thus leading to bad work life balance. After you learn these skills in a project you are shifted to another project that demands some other skillsets. For junior developers this is good as they can learn many technologies in their early career. But for mid to senior developers, you'll be constantly (or implicitly) assessed by peers creating lots of pressure to learn lots of tools in a short period of time and you need to prove by delivering the project as well. ThoughtWorks management should understand this situation and should provide right kind of support."

                "Cons": "Management is lacking. Seems to have a pretty high attrition rate, despite upper management saying \"Oh it's less than x%, we are doing good\" Extremely stingy on sending employees on proper, official courses to get training. Lack of proper structure in getting new hires up to speed. Performance reviews feel like an empty shell, it seems near impossible to get the 'higher' ranks of review and at best everyone is just given the 'average' performance. If I took the time to organise and plan external activities OUTSIDE of my jobscope FOR the company multiple times, and I still only get an \"average\" review, then I'm sorry, I don't think I will put in the extra effort anymore. Upper management seems to still idolize the \"start-up\" vibe where everything is \"open-concept\" and \"collaborating\" despite now being a huge company that obviously cannot follow such ideals without proper adjustments. If you want collaboration, yet also want \"secrecy\" where any employee not involved in a particular project is NOT allowed to know anything about it, how would you even do that? It's just contradictory. Also, hot-desking just kills any possible attachment one would have to go to office. Bring in the point that upper management seems like they refuse to entertain the idea of permanent WFH (without govt intervention), it just seems like a recipe for losing employees in this current COVID era. There is simply no proper office culture as to speak, and without dedicated team seating and areas no one will willingly mingle and interact given the current situation there. Edited this review for the recent OMICRON surge in SG: Despite the large surge, we still get an 'official notice' to be 'encouraged' to go back to office, when it is actually mandatory to go back to office 3 days a week. All this despite WFH having no significant impact on our work (as software engineers)"

                "Pros": "I felt valued from day 1. I was treated with respect by very senior leaders within the company and that my opinions mattered. There were ample opportunities for growth and plenty of support to do what's important. The culture at Indeed is just wonderful. People were always helpful and not only is it encouraged - it is recognized and rewarded. Indeed does not practice \"stack ranking\" during performance evaluations which promotes a high level of collaboration between individuals. Evaluations and promotions are highly transparent, which meant that every individual knew what it takes for their own career progression. The engineering teams in Singapore contribute to efforts that are crucial to Indeed's global machinery. What one does impacts all of Indeed worldwide - the teams here contribute to efforts across very different domains, ranging from payments and apply to our salary and educations product that are used by more than 250m active jobseekers worldwide. There are no lack of interesting, impactful problems to solve! Compensation for engineering in Indeed is one of the best in the Singapore tech landscape. This is supplemented by excellent healthcare and other \"standard\" tech benefits like daily catered meals, well stocked pantry and flexible working hours. To prevent people from burning out, Indeed instituted monthly \"You days\" which are Indeed wide holidays for all employees. On top of that, all employees have unlimited paid-time-off and managers would actively encourage their teammates to utilize this benefit. It is very clear that leadership all the way from the top cares about a healthy work-life balance here in Indeed. Indeed also embraces working remotely. While the offices have reopened, all employees have the flexibility to work from home or from the office. Indeed provides a small monthly stipend as a WFH allowance. You won't regret joining Indeed!",
                "Cons": "The lack of brand prestige working for Indeed is about the only minus I can think of. Indeed is relatively unknown here and that limits Indeed's ability to hire well in this market."

Their culture of transparency and providing consistent support to their employees wellbeing has undoubtedly set me up for success in my career and to develop my personal growth. While there is a lot of learning about the product and how to explain it in layman terms, Indeed provided a lot of training opportunities and coaching from experienced managers to help you achieve your goals. If you work in Sales, it will be a challenging experience and it's important to be on top of your book of business. However, if you disqualify, manage your time and focus on the clients that want to talk to you and need your help, then you will reach your quota and open a lot of doors for your personal brand as well as expand your network. I learned so much from Indeed, my managers, and peers that hone in on my soft skills so no doubt that it made me more resilient and adaptive to the current environment and more importantly work effectively as a team to reach our goals. Other nice perks include unlimited PTO, work-home balance, work from home allowance and free swag.",
                "Cons": "Communication with other teams located in different offices across the globe can lead to delays in getting campaigns started and issues resolved which can be frustrating. Sometimes they ask you to create a ticket again after raising the incorrect one or if there is information missing, you need to start from the beginning in raising a case again. This sort of admin work is unnecessary and adds to an already heavy workload to AEs so if there is a little flexibility introduced to this then it would really drive results faster. When you sell an annual subscription, you can only receive a quarter of the revenue added to your dash each quarter. If the account moves to Growth then the new rep gets the remaining revenue due despite the fact that you closed an annual deal."

                "Cons": "- Lots of talk, but little real action: Since Indeed in Singapore hires a lot more \u201cmanagers who talk fancy\u201d rather than \u201cactual doers\u201d, there\u2019s very little work that actually gets accomplished on a weekly basis. Most work gets caught up in holding patterns of useless debates/micro-alignment, and eventually teams celebrate tiny A/B tests at the end of 3 months as \u201cmassive impact\u201d. The actual amount of work that gets each quarter is a joke, really! - The office is pretty much a satellite engineering office for the most part: Strategy/goals gets \u201chanded down from the top\u201d from US bosses. Or even if the teams come up with bottom-up ideas \u2014 they need \u201cpermission from the top\u201d to even try it out. The culture is very top-down for the most part. - The management in the US doesn\u2019t trust the teams in Singapore, hence prepare to be micro-managed a lot. Have a problem with micro-management? Sorry, you\u2019re not \u201caligned\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t even try pushing back as micro-management (ex: getting your simple A/B experiments approved before testing) is the expected cultural norm here. - Culture in Singapore reminds you a lot of working in a large bank: Lots of politics, people sweet-talking on the face while they complain behind your back, lots of talk around process yet very little work actually gets done, leaders who do a lot of theoretical pseudo-intellectual debates but with little practical implementation knowledge nor experience. - Hiring processes are broken: The quality of the people varies a lot. You might find an occasional outlier rockstar but huge variations in quality of folks. From a Singapore standpoint, the overall avg engineering quality is definitely below market, and part of it can also be attributed to the quality of product-mandates held by Singapore teams \u2014 since the work is not very challenging, you don\u2019t tend to attract the best engineers anyways! How many engineers would just want to move around a couple of buttons everyday?"

In the interview, I was told there is awesome work life balance here, and almost no OT here which is totally not the truth. You are expected to work 10-12 hours a day. Though it's not enforced directly, it is implied by team lead and manager. They assigned you the overwhelmed work to do which is even out of your job scope, then told you that you can stop your work at 6pm. But the workload is definitely couldn't be finished before 6pm. Even you sacrifice yourself and work overtime every day, the work will never be completed. Because they keep assigning you the work more and more, and lastly give you the worst and false evaluation even though how hard you worked. -Poor management. Poorest management team, you couldn\u2019t imagine a team can be leaded by these kinds of people: they are emotional, unprofessional, childish, lack of basic working knowledge. They couldn\u2019t accept any different voice, and keep building \u201cyes-man\u201d around them. The leads keep making mistakes but all will become subordinate\u2019s faults, that\u2019s their way. -Office politics. It\u2019s so funny even there is office politics in such a small team, and 2 team leads in the same team. The power-hungry leads use their subordinates as a tool to fight for their promotion. So, subordinates must become victims. -Border bullying culture Harassment behavior from team leaders and managers. Even they have an ethical team or HR department who should take care of this kind of issue, and you reported to them you have mentally exhausted due to endless border bullying, but no one take care of this issue seriously, and no one will care you, anyway you\u2019re replaceable.

                "Cons": "Company strongly focuses on outsourcing and belies any project can be done with quickly trained individuals. Very little people in SG have professional cloud certs and it looks like the management can't sustain higher pay for tech people (if you're tech skilled, just go to FAANG). They prefer to rely on offshore people and just focus on project management The management likes long term planning e.g. five year plans... There's no incentive to develop personally unless told in top-down manner by management It looks like consultants are oversold to clients, so they expect professionals, not juniors. My client that was using company services was so angry because of what they got, they were hostile to consultants and eventually stopped cooperation. Such approach is not uncommon, clients can be obnoxious towards consultants and the management even can't do much because at the end of the day, clients gives money... The fact that no one in the local management is in their 50's, is very worrisome. It means that the company couldn't develop strong enough business, so that more mature people would join them. I felt bad when was talking with some of the people from management, because of their immaturity"

                "Pros": "Onboarding project (also called TW launch) was a great time together working as a team. I was surprised by the scale of it. There was a lot of effort done behind the scene for new joiners to have an amazing learning experience on TW ways of working. Personally it was a good refresher on Agile practices. Thanks to the whole team, each and every one brought their past experience and learnings to the table and we all worked together for a common goal with excellent team dynamics. Both trainers hosted all the sessions very well and guided each and everyone of us. Initial few days before onboarding project was also engaging time with lot of things to go through. All the activities were well planned and were very smooth. It didn\u2019t feel like one is starting fresh in a new organisation.",
                "Cons": "In person interaction is always better than remote, and its even more important for a new member. Its a shame due to covid restrictions this couldnt have been better. However given the situation team did well with onboarding."

I had the opportunity to attend a conference in Berlin using the budget. - The People (HR) team is awesome, and they focus on ensuring every TWer is looked after and provided the necessary support. - For most of the projects, as technical consultants we are given the opportunity to shape the product and decide the infrastructure - Probably the first technical team I have worked as a developer where the gender diversity ration is exactly 1:1.",

Having been in previous companies before that have competent leadership too, this stands out. - Pivoted to remote work due to C19 swiftly despite complexity of having to manage client expectations. Was also easy since TW has operated on a trust-basis in terms of working hours from a long time ago. - structure of company is improving since before the sale of the company to APAX, more consistency and transparency as a result. - Keen focus on growth and cultivation, not just lip service. Internal capability growth tools and sessions on top of personal development budget. - Colleagues are outstanding and high-calibre.",

                "Pros": "1. Unlike other IT consultancies out there, consultants in TW really pay attention to software quality, devops automation and good coding practices. This is a good place to learn these skills. 2. There are many project sharing sessions, books clubs event etc. 3. No jerks policy - Many TW-ers you will meet are very friendly and jerks usually do not last long in TW. The management takes care of employees even during Covid-19 by sending snacks and hand-written cards.",
                "Cons": "1. Echoing what the previous reviews mentioned, there are limited trainings available in TW SEA. To add more details, most of the trainings in SEA are tapping onto programmes conducted by other TW offices or conducted by consultants who happen to be free. In SEA, there are also only 2-3 training licenses (e.g. PluralSight) being shared and rotated among hundreds of consultants and you can only keep one license for 3 months which is hardly enough. The personal training budget is also insufficient. 2. There are usually gaps between what was promised pre-hire and after hire. Have spoken to many new folks who are interested and expecting to do frontend or analytics from their interviews conversations but were all staffed to be full stack engineers. This might be because interviews, staffing and actual projects are handled by different people who are not aligned. 3. Attrition is high. Experienced consultants usually leave after a year or two, usually for higher compensation or job scopes better aligned with their own career interests. At the same time, there are many fresh graduates being hired. While I agree we can train fresh grads to be good developers, it will take time. We need to retain more experienced and talented individuals in TW first. This trend of TW SEA becoming bottom-heavy in terms of experience is getting worrisome for slips in capabilities and quality."

This is also supported by the company's dedicated personal budget for learning each employee is entitled to as well as learning platform. - Flat hierarchy - Both senior and junior devs have almost equal standing when it comes to voicing your opinions in team discussions. Junior devs are very much encouraged to be active in technical discussions and get to work closely with clients - You have the freedom and space of what you want to focus on and you'll be supported by your team/company. For example, you can focus more on being Infrastructure Engineer after a period of time focusing on App Development. - Really appreciate the feedback culture in the company - Most teams will practice regular feedback so you'll know where you stand and keep improving. - Some ThoughtWorkers are thought leaders in the industry too, it is very normal to see colleagues speaking at conferences, writing books, etc - Personally find it very inspiring. - The company is also huge and serious in making social impact in the world. There is a dedicated coordinator for all the social initiatives driven by the company, making it easier for employees to be engaged in social initiatives sustainably.",
                "Cons": "- Since the company is in consulting business, there will be times when you're on the beach (or bench, in general consulting term). During this time, you will not be working on client projects but you're expected to drive your own learning. - Lateral-hire training/onboarding can be better. Felt quite lost when I joined the company at first. And teams are generally working in silos in each client project, so if you're new and has no projects yet, it can be tough to get to know other employees. - Salary-wise is not the highest in the industry. Though there is 13th month bonus, there isn't performance-related bonus."

                "Cons": "Company says they want to focus and grow the design so they decided to put two head of design for a team of 20 people? which doesn't make any sense. I have been working with them for quite a long time now and I can say both lack design skills and the leader mindset.  All they can do is just one thing... \"TALK\". Both can't deliver. I doubt if they have ever done any end to end design delivery.  Both head of design behave like mothers \"do this, do that\". They don't want to give autonomy to the team and want to control everything. Yup almost everything. e.g if both are busy the team gets messages like we can't make it today, let's cancel today's meet. We'll put something new\" which never happens. Every team conversation is just about two buzz words, 'Value' and 'Impact' but the team always wonders what exactly does that mean? I bet just like the team they also don't know what both words are and they just use them to show off. It's quite common in the office to use buzz words. Both ladies have two faces. One for TW & SG leadership team and this face is very shiny, everything is going excellent, we are leaders and design is adding tremendous value, another one is with a team which is very dark and scary. There is literally zero team communication which happens because nobody has any interest. Why because both leaders fail to create that environment for the team which TW MD's and HR failed to see and understand.Team feels both are incapable and lousy design leaders. It's just no one wants to talk about this because all they care about is just doing the job and getting a salary. Everyone in the design team is on the verge of leaving TW because of these two. Maybe that's the reason people have started moving out of TW. There are other tons of points but i know nothing will happen because TW MD's will just talk to these two and both are smart enough to cover and brainwash MD's. It's just hopeless. They have decided to hire Sr and Lead designers instead of promoting internally. Why? Because both leaders fail to connect designers/team or mentor designers so that they can grow.  All both care about is their 'own' growth and faking around. Question is who will save TW SG Design team?"

                "Cons": "- Work life balance: In most of the cases, ThoughtWorks takes up very critical and rescue based projects. Because of the nature of the projects, you need to be expert in a technology to solve the issues that occur during the development. And at the same time, it is very difficult, especially in these modern days, to learn many tools and technologies out there in the market. This creates lots of pressure on the developers and makes you to work harder and thus leading to bad work life balance. After you learn these skills in a project you are shifted to another project that demands some other skillsets. For junior developers this is good as they can learn many technologies in their early career. But for mid to senior developers, you'll be constantly (or implicitly) assessed by peers creating lots of pressure to learn lots of tools in a short period of time and you need to prove by delivering the project as well. ThoughtWorks management should understand this situation and should provide right kind of support."

Secondly, I joined less than a year, now I\u2019m seeing them chopping off existing headcount, and all hiring freeze. Poor talent retention, and obvious cronyism. Their cloud solution needs tremendous improvement. I\u2019m not surprised looking at their poor cloud penetration and performance. Literally less than 10% of my customers even asking about Oracle Cloud. My friends in the similar industry said the same. Lack of clear and proven strategy. Fire your existing HR TEAM, so the new ones able to find and recruit the right talent. Almost non existence of marketing campaign with clear messaging. Leaders are incompetent. Many are yes man or yes woman. Bring them along to meet customer, they are mumbling gibberish topics. Customers are discombobulated. If any of you thinking of joining them, think twice. Their only hope is the on-premise licenses, unfortunately no one is focusing that. Doom day."

There is no healthy discussion because people are too afraid to question bad ideas from leaders, so bad ideas from leaders are blindly implemented and not well thought through. Business owners who are not technology professionals are the ones to make decisions about technology investments. If you rightly wouldn't let non-investment professionals make decisions about which financial investments GIC puts money in, why would you let non-tech professionals decide which tech systems GIC buys? Non-tech business owners do not know how to think about tech adoption or how to realise business value from tech. They make ill-considered decisions based on fancy UI and functionality they heard about, and do not consider other important factors such as the capabilities of existing systems which can meet their needs with some reconfiguration/upgrades, the already-fragmented end user experience and lack of time to use more new systems, scalability of the new system, compatibility with other existing systems, post-implementation support and maintenance models/costs, vendor maturity, whether the Tech Department has the right skillsets and capacity to implement and support new systems post go-live. Advice from the Tech Department (to leverage existing systems for example) fall on the deaf ears of business owners who are fixated on launching new systems to boost their careers and meet their personal KPIs. Little to no business value is realised from such new systems which become white elephants with low usage and are decommissioned after just a few years. The hidden costs in terms of time, manpower and money that went into the implementation and post go-live support/maintenance are unjustifiable. At a time when most technologically-mature companies are moving towards tech consolidation, GIC is moving in the opposite direction because business owners making tech investment decisions are not experienced tech professionals, and they do not respect the inputs of the tech SMEs. Imagine if non-investment professionals make decisions about which financial investments to put GIC's money in based on what they feel or hear from their circles or vendors! The country will soon be in financial ruin. Giving non-tech professionals the final say in tech investments is just as bad and a recipe for disaster that has led to a highly fragmented system landscape with multiple overlapping duplicate systems and low user adoption. Even adding head count to the Tech Department requires agreement from the business departments that the manpower costs are charged back to. Since the business departments do not understand the true scope of work and resist when the Tech Department tries to educate them, getting the correct headcount is a struggle and some teams in the Tech Department that directly support the business departments are chronically under-resourced. Unrealistic expectations from business owners about implementation timelines and scope of work exacerbate the problem, leading to burn out and high turnover in the Tech Department, which the outgoing CTO and previous MD of Tech (who left after just 2 years in GIC) 'explained' away as the effect of a good job market. Apparently the job market has been stellar all throughout the pandemic. Leaders at GIC have a tendency to explain away issues so they do not need to have difficult but necessary conversations with their peers in other departments. With new org changes that removed the CTO position, there may be even less Tech influence and representation at the leadership level. The new Tech MD seems nice enough with the right experience ,but has his work cut out for him. Here's hoping he can turn things around."

                "Cons": "Incredibly low Salary, HR managers are not so good, Most HR assistants do not speak or understand proper English. The courses offered for personal development in collaboration with British Council or MDIS are useless and a waste of time, instead this money can be given to employees as part of their compensation package. The office assistant or the secretary who gives stationery and keys to our storage units is mostly uselsess, unnecessarily rude and a complete racist. She thinks she owns the company. Do not understand why her arrogant behaviour is tolerated. She should be sent to some etiquettes and manners school to learn how to talk with people."

And even the manager of them is also naive, pretend to be nice to employee, and everything is marketing, and every year company is defective. The company changes quite a lot if find the team is not good. And then assign another naive project leader to repeat the same failure story. I have seen many genius programmers left the company. The culture here, exactly not like software engineering company. Just yet another underclass company."

One of the standout features of this company is the open and creative working environment, which has allowed me to feel comfortable and supported in my role. The humane treatment of employees is also a notable aspect of the company culture, as I have always felt valued and appreciated by my colleagues and superiors. The perks and benefits offered by the company, including medical coverage and the option for free food and drinks, are a nice touch and have made my time here more enjoyable. The annual leave policy is reasonable, and the work-life balance has been satisfactory overall especially option to work from home.",
                "Cons": "One of the drawbacks of working at this company has been the lack of opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies or on particularly very challenging or very exciting tasks. Additionally, the organization's large size can sometimes make it difficult to keep up with new changes and updates. While the company has a well-established and successful business model, it may not be as dynamic or fast-paced as a startup. Another potential concern for some employees is the company's practice of laying off staff in the event of economic downturns. While this is a common practice in the industry, it can be stressful for those who may be affected. Finally, the system for career growth and advancement within the company can be somewhat complicated, and it may take some time to progress within the organization."

I believe ALL individuals working in Illumina is responsible and should be equipped with basic English and GDP knowledge (ie able to document their work clearly and objectively as per the process requirement.) Would we rather present our work that is full of gaps and documentation errors to the auditors? It would be more ideal if we stop arrowing certain departments and work together as a team instead. All departments have a part to play. 2) Many manual checks for the end users. Current system can be improved with automation/software. 3) Too many meetings."

This is a result driven by the SG local Quality. Focuses on the small things, different standard between different individuals (the only reason there is a need to have parent child work instructions is because SG and SD quality probably don't agree on some tiny detail). How to enforce a quality standard when often it is what they perceive? Then only when it fits them they quote some document number. After a while, people get tired and start questioning the need and value of the work they do, time spent on these non value added tasks. So many systems in place, but no one to consolidate, and not enough help and resource given to the sustaining team. And little recognition as well. All these systems basically copy the same data from the same source, and just present it in a different way. All for someone's \"project presentation\". Constant changes, but not always for the sake of improvement, but to enforce someone's agenda. Yet the top management like to preach about how improvements are important, then go and build a new system instead of improving the older one. Not only that, they want it quickly too. With little to no support. The capable people are over worked, and the mediocre people get to graze and cruise their days away. That is why the turnover rate is so high."

It hasn't reached the point where it's capable of managing those teams and it results in a lot of poor communication, duplicated work, technical debt between team. Given the above it's scaling way too prematurely, increasing its workforce by 50% alone in 2020. this is driven by its obsession with being first to market and a cash pot of 4 billion to back them up. It highly exaggerates what the tech is capable of in its marketing. At times it feels like they're more concerned with perception rather than getting things done. After riding in their vehicles it seems like they have a lot of major hurdles that i personally dont see them overcoming in the next 5 years and yet their marketing always conveys that it's always coming next year. This feeling is shared by people on the ground, working on cars day to day Excessively forcing diversity and inclusion agendas/presentations on its employees which gets annoying quickly. This is coming from a minority. No notice period for firing or resignation Very little company wide policies or documentation. Results in a lot knowledge just being stuck in the heads of individuals that can leave the company in 1 day."

                "Pros": "I'll start with mentioning I'm biased because I prefer a start-up culture where there are opportunities to take more initiative and have a greater influence over the end product. Motional definitely allows individuals to take ownership of their work and drive solutions cross-functionally across the organization. The leadership are good at being transparent about issues that we're facing and helping solve challenges head-on rather than shying away. Everyone is very open and supportive. There's a solid culture for working together and helping each other rather than just trying to \"climb the corporate ladder\".",
                "Cons": "There are some challenges with overlapping responsibilities and roles across teams. Because every team is empowered to take initiative, many times there are multiple teams that end up working on similar things and duplicating work if they don't coordinate. There's also having \"too many cooks in the kitchen\". Sometimes many people want to provide their opinion which can inhibit progress from being accomplished. It's nice to have data to make decisions, but sometimes if the data does not exist engineers will struggle to make the best decision possible with the data that is available."

                "Cons": "There's a lack of company process, but that is a common thing with startups. This can be a pro and a con, but I've listed it under cons because Motional is working on a safety critical product in a regulated industry. There does seem to be a good understanding of and reliance on ISO-26262, but there aren't a lot of company processes that define the specific implementation of ISO-26262 that Motional wants to follow."

                "Pros": "Motional leaders seem to be generally willing to allow contributors to innovate and pursue ideas they find compelling. There is tremendous flexibility and ability to get the job done however the individual sees fit. Surprisingly for a company of its size and with so much influence/investment by major legacy corporations, there is not a lot of needless process and red tape over relatively trivial things. Overall, the attitude seems generally positive, the diversity of people is relatively strong, and the breadth of the company means there is tremendous opportunity for those who wish to find it. The amount of funding Motional has accrued at this point in 2022 has enabled it to become a relatively large company for AV, which even in light of some points of concern instills confidence in the survival of the company for long enough to really begin to truly scale the technology.",
                "Cons": "Unfortunately, the evolution of Motional as the confluence of several startups and contributions from an automotive OEM and Tier One supplier show...there is a head-scratching amount of work that is lost and redone between product iterations. There are, also, a surprising number of technical capabilities that younger and/or much smaller companies have already attained that Motional has not. A surprisingly dogmatic approach to technology development (ML models for everything!) restricts the pace of advancement and makes for endless headaches on the part of Validation and test teams. Because Motional has only now begun really investing in commercial partnerships (the prior deployment in Las Vegas was really treated as a side show in a lot of ways), it has relatively informal and lax practices and policies around public-facing operations (though, it should be said, not with respect to safety). The extraordinarily conservative nature of the product design (a safety driver AND a safety operator in every vehicle) makes the path to driverless - a goal toward which all AV companies are working - a steep one, even relative to industry peers. The biggest con, in my opinion, is that the lack of structure creates a lot of confusion and churn, and then an incredible amount of duplicated work. It also leads to strained relationships across functions, when the work one group does is not adequately communicated to another, and then priorities/work/finished product conflicts."

Flexible dress code, Flexible hours( of course with you meeting KPI), Good benefits (AL, food voucher & transport allowance) and i truly believe the Founders are nice, trusting(maybe too much) and sincere even though I see some negative reviews on them here. Truthfully, the company was INCREDIBLE for any hungry sales associate when I first joined, they allowed us to acquire merchants from broad categories while recognising renewal sales from merchants we close, everyday I was excited to wake up looking forward to work ( how many can really say that in their job) to build carousell whilst helping merchants build their business growth with carousell and of course growing my paycheque! It was a dream job! With this system it was almost like i was running my own business and i look forward to close new merchants and renewing them showing them growth on their business. I wanted to stay here till retirement.",

Still a 4 star cause i know founders are trying their best, just unfortunate they hired the wrong management. I truly feel sad."

I think I was quite lucky to have a chance to work with very good managers. They gave me advices and opportunities to advance within the company. We have 1 on 1 regularly and generally we discuss about what I want to archive in my career and how to get there. Excellent team and really smart people.

One day they want to become e-commerce for second-hand goods and another day they want to focus on 10 other items - Old employees/leaders play politics - They increase salaries to retain employees (Attrition is always high here) but have no processes, structure in design, engineering, data, product - Company is 9 years old still extremely chaotic, with no processes, no structure, and also growth has been slow. Look at their peers which have grown significantly big - Leaders do mistakes and don't accept them which is horrible - No focus on employee growth/career growth framework Join the company if you - - Want to work in a startup that is still finding its overall strategy and is chaotic (okay with high attrition) - Believe in their vision - Talk to 4-5 ex-employees of your department and if you're convinced with their feedback then only join Lot of good reviews on glassdoor surprize vs conversation I have with employees internally"

There\u2019s a lot of deprecated and poorly documented/hard to understand code because there\u2019s no hard requirements on code standards. It makes people whom these code are handed over to miserable because they\u2019re afraid to break things if they refactor. In general, very little best practices can been seen here, eg people commit large PRs expecting colleagues to review instead of doing a stacked PR, no formatting checks in auto test etc. It\u2019s hard to push for a change in tech culture because the seniors are resistant. Then again, I guess all these are understandable because it\u2019s not a tech company."

                "Pros": "1. Most of the employees here came from worse working environments e.g. Media agencies, toxic local SMEs, Honestbee and hence believe that this grass is a lot greener. If you\u2019ve been through terrible work environments, yes carousell will be (slightly) better. Is it the best place to work in Singapore? Definitely not. 2. There is autonomy to make decisions that have immediate outcomes and visibility, and on some occasions the founders will be verbally grateful to you for them. 3. Most people on the ground here are really trying their best to do what they love and work hard. And yes, if you are looking to join the marketplace experience team, or the tech team - you are most likely to enjoy your experience there. Carousell understands that tech is competitive and will do their best to treat tech hires right, not so much for the other departments. 4. In some departments, there\u2019s a good culture of fun and team bonding. Carousell is intentional about spending time together and bonding, and there will be budget for this too.",
                "Cons": "1. The Carousell group acquired 4 companies over the years - OLX (Philippines), Mudah (Malaysia), Chotot (Vietnam) and OneKyat (Myanmar). There is a lot of mess and neglect in this process and the founders are struggling to understand how to manage them, most people here complain of being overworked, underpaid and under-supported way more than their Carousell counterparts. 2. Management - the Glassdoor reviews that you read here are true. Even though most of management came from affluent and long standing histories of experience, most of them just want to oppress their reports. They know nothing and want to be treated like royalty - you will be asked to book meeting rooms for them, teach them how to record on zoom/order food on foodpanda, buy things for them and much more. (To be fair, most of the things experienced are in the People team - high turnover rate a clue?) You will be shocked at how they can say words with no accountability and tact, despite their \u201cexperience\u201d. The founders are much younger than most and clearly struggle to manage them - all these incidents mentioned were bought up to the founders and no action taken, resulting in employees resigning because they gave up hope. 3. As much as they seem to look corporate and SME-like, most people here will admit that it\u2019s still very much like a start up. Little to no processes, constant change in systems and poor communication downstream. 4. There is a deep systemic resentment towards salary. The context is as a startup, most employees who have been there for years received start up pay. Only up till a year ago, the management decided to pay competitively to new hires and that\u2019s when the bitterness and comparison arose. Imagine only getting half or less of the salary of your counterpart and doing the exact same work - as much as this is common, Carousell is not an MNC and it doesn\u2019t come with any MNC benefits. 5. Burnout culture: is real here. As much as the people experience team tries to sell \u201cwork life balance\u201d and \u201cWellness Wednesdays\u201d, they don\u2019t actually live it out themselves. You will see the team reply to slack or send emails at 12am-1am, people are angry and uncooperative and being told they lack resilience when they are being pushed to breaking point at work. There is deep mistrust for managers as most of them are deemed inexperienced or incompetent. The people team try to mitigate but everyone can tell that they are struggling with their own manager, too. When asked, most of them are on the lookout for better opportunities and said that they will leave in a heartbeat if the opportunity presents itself."

Hiring the wrong people to do the wrong thing. - Do note that a lot of ppl they hire are ahbeng and ahlian that cant even speak properly. Most management are uncle aunty that have load of experience but have no clue how the tech and marketplace works. Company still not profitable. - Imagine in the market for 10y and still losing money, this tells you how bad the company is doing. A lot of the verticals are still losing money until today. Since management are bunch or uncle and aunty, their idea of making money is to increase price of their subscription and ads for those verticals that are doing well. Toxic Culture - lots of politics in the company always regarding who the management likes and dislikes. For a company that is not profitable to have too many managers within a department. A lot of the associates they hire are ex-colleagues of the manages, and managers will prioritise these colleagues in terms of job assignment and promotion. Incompetent staff - a lot of their managers are too incompetent. Asked their project manager a question and took him 2 weeks to answer me. He will organise a Q&A session with us, but its all questions since he cant answer us and can only note down those questions we asked and nvr answer us. Founder is not taking this seriously. They will come in office and chitchat with everyone like they are close friends. Talk like Steve Jobs during meeting and town halls but no have idea on execution and neither do they care."

Personally, they don't treat HR folks as a business too so, HR opinion is the last opinion or better still \"no opinion required\" category. Highly bureaucratic/ political and very traditional in their approach and highly judgemental as leaders. - Attrition: a pretty high double figure attrition and a lot of people have left in HR /Tech/ product teams, clearly because they felt less heard or the leaders didn't work too hard to retain talent. Try avoiding - Interview process: is long, very long, very very long. They want to compete with FAANG company process but pay you peanuts in salary. They are always depending over budgets. People team and TA team have maximum attrition this year, they say \"i hear you\" and ask you to move on. very insensitive even though they pretend to sound concerned and neglect you after sharing concerns. Overall as an organisation, the co-founders pop up during townhalls to talk about company performance but very less invested in people and they go quiet on decisions for people. They may hear you out but they don't care to action out probably max assign your managers to deal with your issues. In that matter, none of the management really cares to hear about your concerns, it's too fake to be honest. So unless, you are a reference or you know some leaders well - you are bound to grow slowly in this space, highly biased in decisions and very likely to hear you out but not provide any solution or leave it to the managers to take biased decisions. P.s. Carousell is more responsive on glassdoor than actually solving problems internally."

                "Pros": "Recommended for Indian India origin. 90% are of indian origin. Eg out of a dept of 180 around 90%are indian. Let's not forget there are other departments too. The other dept too are dominated by Indian. It is very normal to see a reporting structure of up to two or three level of indian mgm before reaching the french mgm. It is very safe for indians as they tend to work behind the door, indian style of management. You will fit very well if you are indian.",
                "Cons": "If you are non Indian, it could be discouraging. As the culture is heavily leaning towards Indian culture, it easy to face racism, or simply lack of trust among the indian and non-Indian. Not surprising. Important roles or task usually heavily filtered despite how good you are. They tend to hire their own ppl for important task. Non indian will be filtered for low priority tasks. The rest of the non-Indian roles are more more to fill up the quota. But, indian are almost 90% , strange. Does they ever follow the quota? As you 3ill be working with mostly indian hired contract staff, the staff holds onto information due to insecurity. Be prepare that you will be celebrating Indian festive more than any of the national celebration."

No one cares how u feel or how u are coping. Just do files until u drop dead from exhaustion. Senior management has no KYC experience so they have absolutely no idea on what\u2019s happening on the ground Need to work in office during pandemic even though the job is 95% individual based and requires very little interaction with other colleagues. Now with pandemic over, everyone is 100% working in office. And nobody bothers to ask us if we are ok with coming back to office. We are just told to do so. Turnover rate here very high. People leave after 6 months or less. On the other end, those who can\u2019t find opportunities elsewhere are stuck here for years"

Mgt wld rather hire new employees than work at retaining seniors resulting in astronomical turnover rates. Within 1 year, most of the seniors have left once they had a job offer and mgt's solution is to mass hire fresh grads who dont know what they are getting themselves into. Training for fresh grads are inefficient and slow resulting in a buildup of backlog files and further exacerbating the vicious cycle. It also does not help that mgt decided to change the system of managing files, resulting in a buildup of backlog since last year when previous workload management was a lot smoother."

You will witness managers being racists, making fun of foreign employees' accent, bad-mouthing co-workers, employees who are resigning or resigned, and even counterparts in Paris/overseas.

But lack of experience in managing a rapidly growing company. There are opportunities for direct access to senior leaders. E.g senior leaders bother to turn up for presentations.",

Team compete against team to outshine each other instead of collaborating together. Promotions come if you are vocal enough. Some processes are very backward and require streamlining."

Singapore office located in CBD very convenient with lots of f&b options Two very nice pantries! Office very well renovated Fair remuneration MNC efficiency e.g smooth onboarding and staff administration",
                "Cons": "1 star experience only at the Singapore customer service department. Kindergarten style of management. If you need to go toilet when it's not your fixed break timing, please inform the class monitor or teacher. Micromanagement If you need to go to toilet beyond an arbitrary \"reasonable timing\", be prepared to be questioned. Office politics. To be fair this happens everywhere, but I was very surprised it happens in a call center because other call centers are well known to be free of politics at agent level at least. Was pretty glaring too. Like I said it happens everywhere, even in schools, just like in school, where you have teacher's pet and the rest. Extreme high turnover rate gives clues about the environment. Vast majority of agents do not stay beyond 2 to 3 years, those who can stay 1 year and longer are considered seniors. Most leave in a matter of weeks or months, you see people come and go all the time. People leave due to high work stress (not easy to meet the kpi and multitasking, work processes are also tedious and everchanging) and on top of that still need to deal with people issues aka office politics. In other call centers you see people staying for decades. Not much leeway for keen new agents who are late bloomers or need more time to cope with the steep learning curve, as it's very stats oriented. Management critical of agents but don't apply the same level of standards to themselves. Give just 1 example, it is only fair to be punctual yourself before you criticise others for lateness. Rules not equally applied, most glaring example is with regards to usage of handphone at workstation."

Being in Singapore has directly held me back from promotion due to decision makers being located in the US. Prioritisation and decision making is probably the two biggest things holding Stripe back. Its difficult to prioritise as an IC because leaders don't give you a good idea or help on what should be prioritised. Because of this there's a seemingly endless number of projects people are spending (and often wasting) their time on because no one effectively tells people they need to not prioritise it. Its widespread and pervasive. Decision making its the weakest point. Simple decisions (i.e. decisions on things that have low risks and can very easily be undone) takes ages to decide on."

People management involves being responsible for the growth, wellbeing and career trajectories of actual human beings, Too many junior managers at Stripe simply given the role of managing a team without having any clue what they are supposed to do on a day to day basis. This results in ALOT of unnecessary attrition of otherwise good talent which I have personally witnessed. Not enough emphasis and importance placed on the growth of APAC offices, product localisation, new market launches, local pain points and talent development are often overlooked/deprioritised and severe lack of internal mobility that is otherwise seen in the US/EMEA offices."

                "Cons": "- The work life balance is *bad*. For how many products Stripe has, we are a very lean company. Too lean. There's just a lot of work, and very very tight deadlines, very fast paced, and not enough engineers and product managers to do all of it. If you want WLB as an engineer, join an infrastructure team, not a product team. - There is little to no investment in making the engineering org more diverse. This was surprising to me because of a lot of public facing company statements, but don't be fooled like I was. People (at least in the eng org) do not care about diversity. - HR sucks. And of course they would, I guess. But I had a really negative experience with HR where I walked away feeling completely devalued and gaslit. - Dev environments kinda suck and make the work a lot slower than it should be."

First, most people who work at Stripe hate it and verbally say that. However, Stripe pays a lot, and that is a reason for people to stay. I remember a recruiter telling me a Stripe is one of the best-paying companies. If another company pays more, they have a boring product or a terrible culture. Stripe has to spend a lot as well because the culture is toxic. There is a culture of selfishness, intimidation and creating fear to let people do what they want. I tried to contact HR to share my story in multiple situations, but they didn't want that. They point you to the virtual door. At this time, when you experience inappropriate behaviour, HR should listen to you; however, in my case, that did not happen. I understand that money is, to most people, a big driver, but Stripe is not worth it. They have a high turnover rate, and this is because of the culture in the organisation. I know many people who started working after I left the organisation, and they all say it was one of there worst experiences in their working career."

                "Cons": "Senior management does not seem to know that their employees are humans, not robots. In this company and on my team, there's hardly any team activity, chit-chat, social activity, team building, lunch/dinner, etc. Most teams in the company are distributed but managers are not trained nor capable of managing remote employees. Hence, people in this company don't talk to each other casually that much. They are like work robots who only communicate for work. Slack is work and work only. The company doesn't invest in any social activities like Christmas party. I am not saying that I love corporate events. But there is zero... Hence, people just turn on their company at 9am, work on their laptop and never talk to each other like humans do. Employees have very weak personal relationships with each other. It's soul crushing. The only thing they offer is equity, which is a golden handcuff. They don't offer you cash raises that much during performance reviews. If you perform well, you get these equity grants in March which only start vesting quarterly from August (5 months later). That's their way to trap you in this awful environment for longer. The CEO loves Amazon. I suppose that's why they created this Amazon-like fear-driven environment. People are afraid to speak up. They don't dare to challenge their boss. They do whatever their boss says, until all of a sudden, their bosses are let go without notice. They actively manage people out even though sometimes our systems, onboarding and environment didn't allow employees to succeed. Employees are just let go without notice. You will often here \"today is XXX's last day / last Friday was their last day\". It's like a zombie movie. In employee survey, lots of people indicate that they don't want to stay in the company for more than 1-2 years and they don't feel like there is any career growth. But management never addressed them or tried to do anything to change it. When they talk about \"culture\", it's about \"productivity and efficiency\". Stripe only hires people who've been doing a similar job for many years. Therefore, people can't easily move internally to try something different. Leadership doesn't invest in or sponsor any DEIB activities. A lot of employees are not happy that they did a private equity raise instead of IPO, which would have likely set us at a higher valuation. If you're a productive and soulless robot who loves being tied to a golden handcuff while working on a payment software seeing your coworkers disappear randomly, this is the place for you to work."

Messy Processes - Stripe has grown so fast that they have struggled to bring their processes up to speed in tandem. It can be difficult to get easy things done. Thankfully, they are aware of the issue and are attempting to resolve it. Overworked - Can't speak to this from a personal viewpoint but I do get the feeling that Stripe is understaffed and overworked in many key departments which is causing a lot of stress."

Sales education is subpar - team mostly gets by because the power of Stripe brand in the market. Spray and pray emailing is common.

Even though you're expected to learn, promote, and sell these products, you won't get paid until the comp team gets around to figuring this out which could take 6 months or longer. - Very little support offered to closers. AEs are expected to do a lot of their own prospecting. The outbound org is still very undeveloped. - Same goes for post-signed support. No clean breaks. Even if you attach a support package to your deal, you'll find yourself continuing to work with that company well after you close the deal. - You spend less time selling and more time working in tickets given the complexity of deals at Stripe. - Really bad sales incentives compared to other high growth sales organizations. Lengthy commission cycles that lack transparency, little to no spiffs (the few I've seen are paltry), although we did just get accelerators! Hell will freeze over before Stripe offers a Prez Club. The equity bonus program mentioned above was the biggest slap in the face."

You will need to admit the fact that you are in the support team after all and therefore you really need to sprint to build your asset; because you will not learn how to code like an engineer, how to sell like a seller, or how to be educated in finance/logistics/procurement/etc. Your tools for success will be the tools developed for the company, or the stakeholder relationships you have built. You are really on your own when it comes to building your career path. With that said, you will get to work with many departments (mentioned above). As a member of a centralized team, you are responsible for coming up with what top-notch service you can bring to the customers and internal stakeholders. You will be responsible for your own career. It is not recommended if you are type of person who is looking to work in an easy environment where you don't have to work hard but still get paid because you work for a tech giant."

                "Cons": "- You might not get the stock options you've been promised. The stock option process is that your manager has 10 days at the beginning of the quarter to start the stock option grant process and get it approved by specific people. If anyone doesn't approve it for any reason (sick, off, forgot), you don't get your stock grant and need to wait for the next quarter. The number of the stock options in your grant depends on the stock price of the previous quarter. The stock price has doubled in the past 3 months, so employees who didn't get their stock options grant approved in time last month will get half the number of the stock options they were promised, in addition to not receiving stock options this quarter. Because of this, a fair number of people lost dozens of thousands of dollars. When this happens, no one will let you know that you're not getting your stock options. If you ask, the company will let you know that this is the company policy and that they have planned to change the way stock option grants work. It's been one year that the stock option grants are supposed to change in 2 quarters. It's still supposed to change in 2 quarters. - Each team gets the same budget for the pay increases (percentage-wise) and the team impact and performance doesn't matter. - A lot of smart people left. There are more and more employees who don't care about making an impact. - There are more and more dumb company policies and it's getting harder to challenge them but most people don't care. It's a bit like what you would see in a bank."

There are other teams not suffering from these problems, they are pretty ok, not FAANG ok but ok for the tier Wise is in. - Your work is highly derivative. Product and engineering leadership in this office do not believe in building/owning anything new, nor do they believe in localising the product better. As a result, a large portion of your work revolves around adapting something built explicitly for Europe (but said to be \"generic\") to Asian market. It is simply very boring work on archaic tech stack. - Your hours can be very long. Something is constantly on fire and your regular workload isnt exactly light already. I found myself constantly shifting gear from 120% to 150%, never getting a break. You need to work with a lot of people in EU timezone on services you do not own to get anything done and they will not accommodate you. The result is a lot of compulsory work in your evening. In the entirety of the company (which is not bad frankly for engineers), you will find regional expansions team's long hour vs uninspiring work produces the worst payoff for your perf and learning."

When there is an issue that needs escalation, there is no finger pointing and the discussion is always about how to fix the issue first. - Side projects are available on an application basis, so that CS agents can work with another non-CS team on improving the product based on their insights working on the ground.",
                "Cons": "- Product is expanding faster than the rate of hiring. There have been several crises that have caused customer contacts to balloon, but management have only come up with stop gap measures each time. They have not been able to come up with solutions that systemically fix the issues that cause CS agents to be overwhelmed. - In terms of treating employees, it feels like Wise is more interested in rigidly equal treatment rather than *equitable* treatment. Leads don't seem interested in making case-by-case concessions for staff who may need more support than others, on the rationale that \"if we make an exception for you, everyone else will start asking for exceptions\". - Unless you are intending to become a CS Team Lead, the career progression in CS is rubbish. Appraisals leading to pay increments are only conducted once a year after winter regardless of join date, for a mere two hundred dollars increment. Also, the leads seem more interested in keeping you in their team for as long as possible (so as to avoid frequent turnover) and don't actively look out for opportunities for you to transit to other teams unless you ask for it. - Workforce management has a tendency of making sweeping and knee jerk changes to how CS agents work based on productivity statistics alone, without first conducting qualitative surveys to ask how we are doing. - Outsourced CS staff are not provided with adequate backend access to solve customer cases and are merely there to repeat what is already on our FAQ pages. Often, when they escalate cases to full time staff, it's regarding angry customers who had an issue that could have been solved quickly if a full time staff had attended to the case immediately. On several occasions, we've even been asked to help attend to the outsourced staff's inbox directly because they are overwhelmed. Doesn't this defeat the purpose of hiring outsourced staff, who are there to alleviate the full time staff's load?"

                "Cons": "Internal job promotions or interviews for higher positions are fake. Most of the time the interviews are just done as a formality when they already have someone they want in mind. There are also times when a internal role was given to someone without a formal interview or sufficient backing. Promotions here are not based on work but based on relationships. The phrase here \"fake it till you make it\" is apt. There is also a disproportionate amount of female leads within the company. There's also a lot of fluff culture within the leads that just pat each other's back for a good job without considering how their team members feel or addressing our concern."

Being in Singapore has directly held me back from promotion due to decision makers being located in the US. Prioritisation and decision making is probably the two biggest things holding Stripe back. Its difficult to prioritise as an IC because leaders don't give you a good idea or help on what should be prioritised. Because of this there's a seemingly endless number of projects people are spending (and often wasting) their time on because no one effectively tells people they need to not prioritise it. Its widespread and pervasive. Decision making its the weakest point. Simple decisions (i.e. decisions on things that have low risks and can very easily be undone) takes ages to decide on."

People management involves being responsible for the growth, wellbeing and career trajectories of actual human beings, Too many junior managers at Stripe simply given the role of managing a team without having any clue what they are supposed to do on a day to day basis. This results in ALOT of unnecessary attrition of otherwise good talent which I have personally witnessed. Not enough emphasis and importance placed on the growth of APAC offices, product localisation, new market launches, local pain points and talent development are often overlooked/deprioritised and severe lack of internal mobility that is otherwise seen in the US/EMEA offices."

                "Cons": "- The work life balance is *bad*. For how many products Stripe has, we are a very lean company. Too lean. There's just a lot of work, and very very tight deadlines, very fast paced, and not enough engineers and product managers to do all of it. If you want WLB as an engineer, join an infrastructure team, not a product team. - There is little to no investment in making the engineering org more diverse. This was surprising to me because of a lot of public facing company statements, but don't be fooled like I was. People (at least in the eng org) do not care about diversity. - HR sucks. And of course they would, I guess. But I had a really negative experience with HR where I walked away feeling completely devalued and gaslit. - Dev environments kinda suck and make the work a lot slower than it should be."

First, most people who work at Stripe hate it and verbally say that. However, Stripe pays a lot, and that is a reason for people to stay. I remember a recruiter telling me a Stripe is one of the best-paying companies. If another company pays more, they have a boring product or a terrible culture. Stripe has to spend a lot as well because the culture is toxic. There is a culture of selfishness, intimidation and creating fear to let people do what they want. I tried to contact HR to share my story in multiple situations, but they didn't want that. They point you to the virtual door. At this time, when you experience inappropriate behaviour, HR should listen to you; however, in my case, that did not happen. I understand that money is, to most people, a big driver, but Stripe is not worth it. They have a high turnover rate, and this is because of the culture in the organisation. I know many people who started working after I left the organisation, and they all say it was one of there worst experiences in their working career."

                "Cons": "Senior management does not seem to know that their employees are humans, not robots. In this company and on my team, there's hardly any team activity, chit-chat, social activity, team building, lunch/dinner, etc. Most teams in the company are distributed but managers are not trained nor capable of managing remote employees. Hence, people in this company don't talk to each other casually that much. They are like work robots who only communicate for work. Slack is work and work only. The company doesn't invest in any social activities like Christmas party. I am not saying that I love corporate events. But there is zero... Hence, people just turn on their company at 9am, work on their laptop and never talk to each other like humans do. Employees have very weak personal relationships with each other. It's soul crushing. The only thing they offer is equity, which is a golden handcuff. They don't offer you cash raises that much during performance reviews. If you perform well, you get these equity grants in March which only start vesting quarterly from August (5 months later). That's their way to trap you in this awful environment for longer. The CEO loves Amazon. I suppose that's why they created this Amazon-like fear-driven environment. People are afraid to speak up. They don't dare to challenge their boss. They do whatever their boss says, until all of a sudden, their bosses are let go without notice. They actively manage people out even though sometimes our systems, onboarding and environment didn't allow employees to succeed. Employees are just let go without notice. You will often here \"today is XXX's last day / last Friday was their last day\". It's like a zombie movie. In employee survey, lots of people indicate that they don't want to stay in the company for more than 1-2 years and they don't feel like there is any career growth. But management never addressed them or tried to do anything to change it. When they talk about \"culture\", it's about \"productivity and efficiency\". Stripe only hires people who've been doing a similar job for many years. Therefore, people can't easily move internally to try something different. Leadership doesn't invest in or sponsor any DEIB activities. A lot of employees are not happy that they did a private equity raise instead of IPO, which would have likely set us at a higher valuation. If you're a productive and soulless robot who loves being tied to a golden handcuff while working on a payment software seeing your coworkers disappear randomly, this is the place for you to work."

Messy Processes - Stripe has grown so fast that they have struggled to bring their processes up to speed in tandem. It can be difficult to get easy things done. Thankfully, they are aware of the issue and are attempting to resolve it. Overworked - Can't speak to this from a personal viewpoint but I do get the feeling that Stripe is understaffed and overworked in many key departments which is causing a lot of stress."

Sales education is subpar - team mostly gets by because the power of Stripe brand in the market. Spray and pray emailing is common. Targets keep increasing as opposed to reflecting the economic environment around us. Pay varies wildly with the more senior and longer running SDRs actually earning MUCH LESS than the newer hires - I've heard of one SDR earning around 60k OTE and another 75k (the pay difference for the same work is disgusting)"

                "Cons": "Sales people are treated as the second class citizens of Stripe: - A special equity bonus program was rolled out to the whole company except sales people. Why? We just heard it's \"too complicated\" to set this up for sales people who are on variable commissions. - You don't get paid on new products you sell. Stripe launches new products all the time. Even though you're expected to learn, promote, and sell these products, you won't get paid until the comp team gets around to figuring this out which could take 6 months or longer. - Very little support offered to closers. AEs are expected to do a lot of their own prospecting. The outbound org is still very undeveloped. - Same goes for post-signed support. No clean breaks. Even if you attach a support package to your deal, you'll find yourself continuing to work with that company well after you close the deal. - You spend less time selling and more time working in tickets given the complexity of deals at Stripe. - Really bad sales incentives compared to other high growth sales organizations. Lengthy commission cycles that lack transparency, little to no spiffs (the few I've seen are paltry), although we did just get accelerators! Hell will freeze over before Stripe offers a Prez Club. The equity bonus program mentioned above was the biggest slap in the face."
